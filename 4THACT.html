It is perfect when you like writing the most especially in Word, or in PowerPoint or just writing and want an extraordinary font, just visit the site and you'll see what you're looking for. The next one is Discord. Discord is one of my favorite communication site, because there are so many features that they offer especially if you are in gaming with your friends far away, this site will be the best to communicate with them while playing. The next one is color hunt. Some might not know about this site, but it's about the font color. As an IT student, I needed to find sites like these that highly needed in my course subjects to help me finish the tasks quicker and easier. This site offer many font colors that you can't imagine. The last one is Pinterest. This site is also one of my favorite because pictures and videos that you may find here are very underrated, beautiful and on a higher level of quality. This site offer this kind of pictures, fashion ideas, cooking ideas and many more. So, these are my favorite sites and hope you visit or use it too and might help you in some ways. </p>
